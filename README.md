Plant Disease Detection using AI
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a Plant Disease Detection system using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform leaf detection and diseases classification in crops. The goal is to provide farmers with a tool that enables early detection of diseases, aiding in timely and targeted interventions for crop health management.

Key Features
Model Training: Utilizes a diverse dataset of annotated crop images for training the CNN model.
Leaf Detection and Diseases Classification: Trains specific sub-models for accurate leaf detection and diseases classification.
Embedded Hardware Integration: Optimizes the models for deployment on embedded hardware, facilitating real-time processing.
Real-Time Video Processing: Integrates with a camera to process real-time video feeds, enabling on-the-fly detection in the field.
Output Alerts: Alerts farmers upon the detection of crop diseases, providing information on the location and severity of issues.
Continuous Monitoring: Establishes mechanisms for continuous monitoring and model updates based on new data.
Usage
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python packages (specified in requirements.txt)

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-detection.git
cd plant-disease-detection
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Model Training
Prepare your dataset and ensure proper labeling.

Execute the model training script:

python train_model.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset
Embedded Hardware Integration
Choose appropriate embedded hardware (e.g., edge computing devices).
Deploy the optimized models to the hardware.
Real-Time Video Processing
Connect a camera to the embedded hardware.

Run the real-time video processing script:

python real_time_processing.py
Continuous Monitoring and Updates
Establish a system for continuous monitoring, providing feedback on model performance.
