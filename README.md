Food Quality Control Project - SECJ3553-15 KEPINTARAN BUATAN (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE)
Project Overview:
The Food Quality Control project is a comprehensive application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the domain of food processing and packaging. This project aims to implement AI-driven solutions to ensure that the final food products meet high-quality standards. Through the integration of cutting-edge technologies, the system will facilitate efficient and reliable quality control measures in the food industry.

Key Objectives:
Implement AI Algorithms: Develop and deploy advanced AI algorithms capable of analyzing various aspects of food products to identify quality issues.

Real-time Monitoring: Enable real-time monitoring of the food processing and packaging stages to detect any anomalies or deviations from quality standards.

Data Integration: Integrate data from multiple sources, including sensors, cameras, and production records, to provide a comprehensive view of the quality control process.

Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback loop to continuously improve the AI model's accuracy and effectiveness in identifying quality issues.

Technologies Used:
Machine Learning: Utilize machine learning techniques for training the AI model on large datasets of food product images and quality parameters.

Computer Vision: Implement computer vision algorithms to process visual data from cameras installed in the production line.

Sensor Integration: Integrate sensor data for additional insights into the quality of food products.

Data Analytics: Employ data analytics tools to process and analyze the integrated data for quality control assessments.

Project Components:
Data Collection and Preparation: Gather a diverse dataset of food product images along with corresponding quality labels for training the AI model.

AI Model Development: Train and fine-tune the AI model using machine learning techniques, focusing on accuracy and real-time processing capabilities.

Integration with Production Line: Integrate the AI system into the food processing and packaging line, ensuring seamless communication with existing equipment and systems.

Real-time Monitoring Dashboard: Develop a user-friendly dashboard for operators to monitor the quality control process in real-time.

Feedback Mechanism: Implement a feedback mechanism to capture operator inputs and incorporate them into the model retraining process.

Stakeholders:
Department of Agriculture Malaysia (DOA): Key regulatory body involved in shaping the agricultural landscape, providing valuable insights into industry standards and regulations.

Food Processors and Packaging Manufacturers: Direct beneficiaries of the project, actively involved in the production process.

Regulatory Bodies: Entities responsible for overseeing and enforcing quality standards in the food industry.
